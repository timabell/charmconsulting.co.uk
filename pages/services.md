Your sherpa up the mountain of successful software delivery.

Having been an integral part of the delivery of many projects we can help **avoid the [major pitfalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_failed_and_overbudget_custom_software_projects)** of this complicated and risky undertaking.

All services are **fully remote** so COVID-safe, and compatible with your own remote-working setups.

Projects can be greenfield, brownfield or legacy.

Each stage contains no commitment to move to the next with us.
